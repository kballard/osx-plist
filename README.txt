== DESCRIPTION:

osx-plist is a Ruby library for manipulating Property Lists natively using the built-in support in OS X.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* CoreFoundation (i.e. Mac OS X)

== INSTALL:

  $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/ (you only need to do this once)
  $ gem install kballard-osx-plist

== SOURCE:

osx-plist's git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at:

  http://github.com/kballard/osx-plist

and cloned from:

  git://github.com/kballard/osx-plist.git

== USAGE:

One new module is provided, named OSX::PropertyList. It has the following 4 methods:

==== OSX::PropertyList.load(input, format = false)

Loads the property list from input, which is either an IO, StringIO, or a string. Format is an optional parameter - if false, the return value is the converted property list object. If true, the return value is a 2-element array, the first element being the returned value and the second being a symbol identifying the property list format.

==== OSX::PropertyList.dump(output, obj, format = :xml1)

Dumps the property list object into output, which is either an IO or StringIO. Format determines the property list format to write out. The supported values are :xml1,, :binary1, and :openstep; however, OpenStep format appears to not be supported by the system for output anymore.

The valid formats are :xml1, :binary1, and :openstep. When loading a property list, if the format is something else (not possible under any current OS, but perhaps if a future OS includes another type) then the format will be :unknown.

==== OSX::PropertyList.load_file(filepath, format = false)

Calls OSX::PropertyList.load() on the file at the given path.

==== OSX::PropertyList.dump_file(filepath, obj, format = :xml1)

Calls OSX::PropertyList.dump() on the file at the given path.

This module also provides a method on Object:

==== Object#to_plist(format = :xml1)

This is the same as PropertyList.dump except it outputs the property list as a string return value instead of writing it to a stream

This module also provides 2 methods on String:

==== String#blob?

Returns whether the string is a blob.

==== String#blob=

Sets whether the string is a blob.

A blob is a string that's been converted from a <data> property list item. When dumping to a property list, any strings that are blobs are written as <data> items rather than <string> items.
